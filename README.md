# cubrid-jdbc-driver
This repository is for issues and announcements only. Each artifact (`cubrid-jdbc-driver-<version>`) has their own repository.

## CUBRID
I honestly don't know why they desided to manage their own repository.

### CUBRID JDBC Drivers
You can download binaries and sources from [CUBRID JDBC Drivers](http://ftp.cubrid.org/CUBRID_Drivers/JDBC_Driver/).

### CUBRID JDBC Maven Repository
Please refer [CUBRID JDBC Maven Repository](http://www.cubrid.org/wiki_apis/entry/cubrid-jdbc-maven-repository) if you don't care about adding their own repository besides the central.

## Want any artifact of specific version available on the central?
Just add an issue. I'll do it for you. It won't take long.
